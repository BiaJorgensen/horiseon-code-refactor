# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The Horiseon Code Refactor project was created as a training on code accessibility and refactor. The HTML file was modified to include semantic elements, it was also cleaned up to have a better flow visually. Moreover, a broken link was fixed to improve code functionality. The CSS file was modified to match the updated HTML elements, and selectors were combined in order to remove unecessary code. All the changes and updates made did not modify the previous code capabilities.
